HI, i am currently learning AI, focusing on prompt engineering and AI development. Nowdays im currently learning and testing new tools, libraries,LLMs.
I primarily use Google Colab to run my tests and experiments, trying out different hubs, models, and frameworks to enhance my skills.
I am also reading books and studying materials to improve my knowledge of AI.
I welcome feedback or suggestions to further refine my work.
Thank you. ;)
